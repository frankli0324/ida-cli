# IDA CLI Reverse Engineering

General reverse engineering methodology plus a practical ida-cli bootstrap and workflow.

---

## Part 0: Zero-Config Bootstrap

Install the skill with:

`npx -y skills add https://github.com/cpkt9762/ida-cli --skill ida-cli --agent codex --yes --global`

After that, do not assume the user has already installed, configured, or started `ida-cli`.

### Boot Rule

- On first use in a new environment, run `scripts/ida-cli.sh --help`.
- This wrapper checks whether `ida-cli` is already available.
- If the binary is missing, it automatically downloads and installs it through the repository installer.
- After installation, it runs a `--help` smoke test before continuing.

### Runtime Rule

- Before starting real analysis, run `scripts/ida-cli.sh probe-runtime`.
- Do not guess whether the machine will select `native-linked` or `idat-compat`.
- If multiple IDA installations are present, set `IDADIR` explicitly before probing.

### Use Rule

- Prefer `scripts/ida-cli.sh` as the single entrypoint.
- Do not ask the user to start the server manually for routine work.
- The flat `ida-cli` CLI auto-manages the local socket server.
- Only run `serve-http` explicitly when a long-lived HTTP control plane is actually required.

### Zero-Config Commands

```bash
# 1. Install ida-cli or confirm it is available
scripts/ida-cli.sh --help

# 2. Probe the selected runtime backend
scripts/ida-cli.sh probe-runtime

# 3. Analyze a binary directly
scripts/ida-cli.sh --path /path/to/sample.bin list-functions --limit 20
scripts/ida-cli.sh --path /path/to/sample.bin decompile --addr 0x140001000

# 4. Start HTTP only when needed
scripts/ida-cli.sh serve-http --bind 127.0.0.1:8765
```

### Environment Notes

- Default install path: `~/.local/bin/ida-cli`
- To pin the repository or branch:
  - `IDA_CLI_REPO=cpkt9762/ida-cli`
  - `IDA_CLI_INSTALL_REF=master`
- To pass extra installer arguments:
  - `IDA_CLI_INSTALL_ARGS="--add-path"`
- To pin a specific IDA installation:
  - `export IDADIR=/path/to/ida/Contents/MacOS`

Within this skill, `scripts/ida-cli.sh` is the single entrypoint for install, download, execution, and verification.

## Part 1: General Reverse Engineering Methodology

### Key Principles

- **F5 first, disasm second (HARD RULE)** — Always attempt decompilation once before dropping to disassembly.
- **10-second F5 gate (HARD RULE)** — If a decompilation attempt clearly fails, or if F5 / `decompile_function` stalls for more than 10 seconds, treat the target as currently non-decompilable and likely heavily obfuscated.
- **Rename as you go (HARD RULE)** — Rename every function immediately after understanding its purpose. Do not keep a backlog of `sub_XXXXX` names.
- **Iterate aggressively** — F5 → apply types → rename → F5 again → validate new offsets → repeat.
- **Treat constants literally** — If IDA shows `0x6E`, write `110` until you have evidence for higher-level meaning.
- **Use disassembly when the diff is small** — A 1-10 value mismatch usually means an off-by-one, saturation behavior, or width issue.
- **Keep an analysis log (HARD RULE)** — After each analyzed function, append one log entry with address, rename, and purpose.

### Decompilation Strategy

Drop to disassembly when:

- F5 errors out
- F5 or `decompile_function` takes longer than 10 seconds
- The pseudocode shows obvious artifacts

When any of the above happens, do **not** keep retrying decompilation in a loop. Assume the function is currently too obfuscated, flattened, or otherwise hostile to the decompiler. Move the investigation down to the disassembly layer and only retry F5 after the underlying blockers are understood or removed.

Recommended response after the 10-second gate triggers:

1. Stop repeated decompilation attempts.
2. Work from disassembly and basic blocks.
3. Recover control flow manually with xrefs, callgraph, and instruction searches.
4. Rename, comment, and apply types from disassembly evidence.
5. Patch or simplify only when you have a clear reason.
6. Retry decompilation after the function is cleaner or better understood.

Common decompiler lies:

| Symptom | Pseudocode | Real instruction pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Constant folding | `result = x * 1718750 / 1000000` | `MUL` + `UDIV` with literal constants |
| Hidden `+1/-1` | `discount = bias * 110 / 64` | There is still an `ADD #1` after division |
| Type confusion | `int v10 = *(int *)(ctx + 0x1DC)` | Real load is `LDR W8` and behaves like `u32` |
| Hidden saturation | `result = a - b` | `SUBS` + conditional select to zero |

### Naming Strategy

Rename functions as soon as they are understood.

Suggested prefixes:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `check_` / `validate_` | validation |
| `parse_` / `deserialize_` | parsing / deserialization |
| `compute_` / `calc_` | computation |
| `dispatch_` | dispatch entrypoint |
| `init_` / `setup_` | initialization |

After renaming a callee, re-decompile the caller immediately. The readability improvement compounds quickly.

### Analysis Log

Record findings in real time. At minimum, log:

- function address
- old name → new name
- one-sentence purpose
- newly recovered structs
- recovered arithmetic formulas
- error-code mappings
- open questions

Suggested format:

```text
## Analysis Log: <binary_name>

### Functions Reversed
| # | Address | Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|---|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | 0x1234  | sub_1234 | parse_header | Parse the message header from the input buffer |

### Structs Identified
| Struct | Size | Key Fields | Used By |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| MsgHeader | 0x40 | +0x00 magic, +0x04 msg_type, +0x08 payload_len | parse_header |

### Open Questions
- sub_9ABC: likely initializes a lookup table, not yet proven
```

### Struct Recovery

Recover structs from repeated `*(ptr + 0xNNN)` patterns.

Typical ARM64 load-width mapping:

```text
LDR X8, [X0, #0x130]   -> u64
LDR W8, [X0, #0x144]   -> u32
LDRH W8, [X0, #0x168]  -> u16
LDRB W8, [X0, #0x178]  -> u8
```

Recommended loop:

1. Decompile and collect pointer+offset accesses.
2. Confirm widths in disassembly.
3. Read live values with byte/word/dword/qword helpers when needed.
4. Declare the struct type.
5. Apply the type.
6. Re-decompile and confirm fields replace raw offsets.
7. Use xrefs on struct fields to propagate understanding.

### Call Graph Navigation

Do not read giant dispatchers linearly.

Use a leaf-first strategy:

1. `build_callgraph` from the entrypoint
2. Decompile leaf functions
3. Rename each leaf immediately
4. Re-decompile callers
5. Repeat upward

### Search Strategy

Remember little-endian byte order on x86 and ARM64:

```text
search_bytes(pattern: "6E 00 00 00")
search_bytes(pattern: "80 96 98 00")
```

Use:

- `search_text(kind: "imm", targets: ["110", "10000"])`
- `search_pseudocode(pattern: "amount")`
- `search_instructions(patterns: ["MUL", "UDIV"])`

### Formula Extraction

Rules:

1. Translate constants literally.
2. Preserve operation order exactly as IDA shows it.
3. Use `u128` for multi-step 64-bit multiplication chains.
4. Watch for saturating behavior.
5. Verify suspicious arithmetic in disassembly.

Diff triage:

| Diff range | Typical cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `> 100` | wrong formula or wrong scale | rebuild from constants |
| `10-100` | wrong operator or operand | verify MUL / DIV / ADD / SUB |
| `1-10` | off-by-one or saturation | compare instruction by instruction |
| `0` | exact match | done |

### Structured Decompilation

Use `decompile_structured` when arithmetic chains are too complex for manual comparison.

Look for:

- `mul`, `div`, `add`, `sub` nodes
- helper calls such as `__umulh`, `__multi3`, `__udivti3`
- numeric leaves
- variable references

Generate the expression from the AST, then cross-check with disassembly.

## Part 2: CLI Quick Reference

This skill is CLI-first. Use the CLI reference page for common commands and argument shapes:

- [cli-tool-reference.md](references/cli-tool-reference.md)

### CLI Examples

```bash
ida-cli --path <file> list-functions --limit 20
ida-cli --path <file> get-function-by-name --name main
ida-cli --path <file> decompile-function --address 0x1234
ida-cli --path <file> disassemble-function --name func_name --count 20
ida-cli --path <file> rename-symbol --address 0x1234 --new-name parse_pool
ida-cli --path <file> get-callees --address 0x1234
ida-cli --path <file> build-callgraph --roots 0x1234 --max-depth 3
ida-cli --path <file> search-pseudocode --pattern "amount" --limit 10
ida-cli --path <file> get-xrefs-to --address 0x1234
ida-cli --path <file> batch-decompile --addresses "0x1234,0x5678"
```

Output modes:

```bash
ida-cli --json --path <file> list-functions --limit 5
ida-cli --compact --path <file> list-functions --limit 5
```

### File Types

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `.i64` / `.idb` | open the existing IDA database directly |
| raw PE / ELF / Mach-O | analyze the binary and cache the database |

### Concurrency Notes

- Different files map to different worker processes.
- Multiple clients can operate on the same file safely, but write-heavy changes should still be serialized deliberately.
- Cold-start races are guarded by the server bootstrap lock.

### Failure Recovery

If the local server wedges:

```bash
ida-cli server-stop
pkill -9 -f "ida-cli"
rm -f ~/.ida/server.sock ~/.ida/server.pid ~/.ida/startup.lock
```

Then retry the CLI call and let it restart automatically.

## Part 3: Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Binary Orientation

1. `get_database_info()`
2. `list_segments()`
3. `list_exports()`
4. `list_imports()`
5. `list_functions(limit: 50)`
6. `build_callgraph(...)`

### Workflow 2: Struct Reconstruction

1. Decompile and collect offsets
2. Confirm widths in disassembly
3. Read values if needed
4. Declare the struct
5. Apply the type
6. Re-decompile
7. Follow field xrefs

### Workflow 3: Arithmetic Verification

1. `decompile_function`
2. `get_pseudocode_at`
3. `disassemble_function_at`
4. `search_instructions`
5. `search_instruction_operands`
6. Compare operand order and widths

### Workflow 3b: Obfuscation Triage After F5 Failure

If decompilation fails immediately or exceeds the 10-second gate:

1. Stop retrying F5.
2. Use `disassemble-function-at` or `disassemble-function` for the full body.
3. Build control-flow understanding from basic blocks, xrefs, and callgraph edges.
4. Mark dispatcher branches, opaque predicates, and flattening state variables.
5. Rename symbols and annotate intent directly from disassembly.
6. Retry decompilation only after meaningful progress has been made at the assembly level.

### Workflow 4: Error Code Mapping

1. Search immediate values
2. Resolve the containing function
3. Inspect the pseudocode context
4. Add comments
5. Search for similar return sites

### Workflow 5: Table and Dispatch Analysis

1. Search strings like `factory` or `registry`
2. Follow xrefs
3. Identify the table builder
4. Scan the table
5. Resolve and decompile each function pointer

### Workflow 6: Multi-Database Analysis

1. Open multiple databases
2. Share handles across concurrent agents
3. Parallelize read-heavy work
4. Serialize write-heavy work
5. Close cleanly after analysis

### Workflow 7: Batch Annotation

Use:

- `batch_rename`
- `set_function_prototype`
- `set_function_comment`
- `rename_stack_variable`
- `set_stack_variable_type`
- `create_enum`
- `batch_decompile`

### Workflow 8: Dynamic Debugging

Use the `dbg_*` tool family for:

- debugger loading
- process start / attach
- breakpoints
- stepping
- register inspection
- memory reads and writes
- thread inspection

When ASLR is active, address-based debug operations must use rebased runtime addresses unless the tool explicitly accepts IDB addresses.

---

## Part 4: Error Recovery

### Decompilation Failure

If decompilation fails:

- if the failure is explicit, or if the decompiler stalls past 10 seconds, classify it as a strong-obfuscation case
- stop repeated F5 attempts
- use `get_pseudocode_at` only for narrow, already-promising ranges
- move to disassembly, basic blocks, xrefs, and callgraph work
- retry decompilation only after the function has been partially untangled

### Incomplete Auto Analysis

If `get_analysis_status` reports `auto_is_ok=false`:

- run `run_auto_analysis`
- or poll until analysis finishes

Do not trust xrefs or decompilation quality before analysis is complete.

### Timeout Handling

- `run_script` defaults to 120 seconds and can go up to 600
- very large `batch_decompile` calls should be split into smaller batches

### Common Mistakes

1. Starting at the biggest entrypoint instead of leaf functions
2. Renaming callees but not re-decompiling callers
3. Trusting arithmetic without checking disassembly
4. Forgetting little-endian byte order in searches
5. Ignoring xref fan-out counts
6. Trusting signed pseudocode types without checking load width
7. Re-opening the raw binary instead of the `.i64`
8. Querying before auto analysis finishes
